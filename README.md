# zig-rs

A build dependency for building [`zig`](https://ziglang.org/) libraries.

## Acknowledgements

- Based on [cmake-rs](https://github.com/rust-lang/cmake-rs) for zig, but way more minimal at the moment (I don't know zig...).
- Skimmed [zig build system](https://ziglang.org/learn/build-system/) for how to build a library.
